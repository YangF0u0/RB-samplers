# RB-samplers
This is the final project for Bayesian Statistics 2023 in SJTU.

## AR sampler v.s. RBAR sampler

The results look good but it takes long to compute.

## MH sampler v.s. RBMH sampler

This part of simulation shows great improvement with RB and computation is fast. But it's only for MH, we can explore the RB-MCMC in the future.
